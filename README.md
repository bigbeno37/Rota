# Rota
“Rota” is a common modern name for an easy strategy game played
on a round board. The Latin name is probably Terni Lapilli (“Three
pebbles”). Many boards survive, both round and rectangular, and
there must have been variations in play.

This is a very simple game, and Rota is especially appropriate to play
with young family members and friends! Unlike Tic Tac Toe, Rota
avoids a tie.

# Board
A center circle is surrounded by 8 equidistant circles, each connecting to their neighbours and the central circle. 

## RULES
**Goal:** The first player to place three game pieces in a row across the center or in the circle of the board wins
- Roll a die or flip a coin to determine who starts. The higher number
plays first
- Players take turns placing one piece on the board in any open spot 
- After all the pieces are on the board, a player moves one piece each
turn onto the next empty spot (along spokes or circle)

A player may not:
- Skip a turn, even if the move forces you to lose the game
- Jump over another piece
- Move more than one space
- Land on a space with a piece already on it
- Knock a piece off a space
